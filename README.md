Sites similar to Abye:

http://www.financialnepal.com â€“ The concept behind financialnepal.com is very similar to ours (but with some [*]important differences). There database is also fairly complete and the user-interface is workable with. This website is currently one of the only Nepali bank rate comparison systems on the internet.


[*] Abye is different from financialnepal.com because financialnepal.com is a portal with cluttered information about a plethora of topics, where as we (Abye) aim to provide a single service and present it in an elegant and user-friendly way.
